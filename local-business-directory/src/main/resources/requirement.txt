Client Brief: Local Directory Service
Project Goal
"We want to launch a simple, online directory for local businesses in our city. Our users—the local community—need a reliable way to find information about the shops, restaurants, and services nearby. The goal is to digitize and centralize local business information."

Core User Stories (What the System Must Do)
Business Registration: "As a staff member, I need to be able to add a new business to the directory by providing its name, category, and full street address."

Information Lookup: "As a user, I need to be able to retrieve all the details for a specific business, like their phone number, website, and operating hours."

Data Maintenance: "As a staff member, I need to be able to update any information for an existing business if, for example, they move locations or change their phone number."

Data Removal: "As a staff member, I need to be able to remove a business from the directory if it permanently closes down."

Key Business Rule
Location is Crucial: "For any business we add, we must somehow store its precise geographical location (its latitude and longitude). This is essential for a future phase where we want to implement search by distance."

🧠 Your Role as the Backend Engineer
Now, your challenge is to translate this vague client brief into a robust API design. This requires you to ask and answer the following questions (which should guide your implementation):

1. Data Contract & Validation (Asking the Client)
What data is absolutely required? (Based on the brief, name, category, and address seem mandatory).

What are the limits? (e.g., How long can the name be? Are there specific categories or is it free-form text?)

How should the coordinates be obtained? (The client mentioned storing precise geographical location, but they haven't mentioned how. You must decide on the Geocoding service integration.)

2. API Design & Security (Internal Decision)
Who can perform these actions? The client used "staff member" for CRUD operations and "user" for reading.

Decision: You need an authentication/authorization mechanism for staff (though for this easy project, you can simulate it with a simple API Key header, or acknowledge that true security like JWT will be added later).

Decision: Read operations (GET) should be public and require no authentication.

What is the API style? (You decide on RESTful API design, consistent URI paths, and standard HTTP methods.)

3. Error Handling & Correctness (Internal Decision)
What happens if the required data is missing? (You decide to implement JSR 380 Validation and return a 400 Bad Request).

What happens if a business ID doesn't exist? (You decide to throw a custom exception and return a 404 Not Found).

4. Architecture & Design Principles (Internal Decision)
How do you ensure the system is maintainable? (You decide to use a strict Layered Architecture—Controller, Service, Repository—to separate concerns.)

How do you make the Geocoding service swappable? (You decide to implement the Open-Closed Principle by using a GeocodingService interface.)

This client brief gives you the "What" (the business need), and it is up to you to determine the "How" (the technical design, data structure, and error handling).
